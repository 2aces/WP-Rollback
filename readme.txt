Rollback any WordPress.org plugin or theme, even WordPress Core like a boss.

== Description ==

Quickly and easily rollback any theme or plugin on WordPress.org to a previous version without any of the manual fuss. Works just like the plugin updater, except you're rolling back to a specific version. No need for manually downloading and FTPing up the files, this plugin takes care of that for you.

= Rollback WordPress Core, Plugins, Themes =

While it's always a good idea to keep WordPress up to date, we understand that there's times you may need to quickly revert to a previous version. This plugin makes that process as easy as clicking as a few mouse clicks. Simply select the version of WordPress that you'd like to downgrade to, confirm, and in a few moments you'll be using the version you requested. No fumbling to find the version, FTPing, or hair pulling.

= Muy Imporante: Always Test and Backup =

**Important Disclaimer:** This plugin is not intended to be used without first taking the proper precautions to ensure zero data loss or site downtime. Always be sure you have first tested the rollback on a staging or development site and prior to using WP Rollback on a live site.

We provide no (zero) assurances, guarantees, or warrenties that the plugin, theme, or WordPress version you are downgrading to will work as you expect. Use this plugin at your own risk.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Rollback, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Rollback" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
